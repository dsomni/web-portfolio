title: "RecSys via Approximate Matrix Factorization"
role: "Developer"
period: "2024"
description:
  "A RecSys built on approximate matrix
  factorization techniques for the synthetic dataset. The project explores
  multiple optimization approaches, such as gradient-based methods with
  various step-size strategies (Armijo, Wolfe conditions, Lipschitz estimation),
  advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad, Heavy Ball, Nesterov),
  and vector-wise updates to solve the collaborative filtering problem"
achievements:
  - "Implemented 12+ optimization algorithms with 7 step-size selection strategies"
  - "Compared full-matrix vs. row-wise/column-wise (Vector GD) update strategies"
responsibilities:
  - "Formulated recommendation as matrix factorization problem"
  - "Implemented 6 advanced optimizers: Adaptive GD, Heavy Ball, Nesterov momentum, AdaGrad, RMSprop, Adam, BFGS"
  - "Experimented with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization using multiplicative updates"
  - "Trained a neural network baseline with genre/demographic features"
