title: "PyFinder: fast search through Python documentation"
role: Developer
period: "2025"
description:
  An Information Retrieval system providing fast search
  through Python's built-in documentation. The platform combines traditional
  inverted indexing with modern LLM-powered semantic search and RAG
  for natural language query processing, featuring content moderation
  and spell correction capabilities
achievements:
  - "Performance with LLM embeddings + Ball Tree indexer: F1@1=0.53, nDCG@1=0.83"
responsibilities:
  - Implemented semantic search using sentence-transformers embeddings and Ball Tree spatial indexing
  - Built RAG pipeline with prompt engineering, context retrieval, and source tracking
  - Developed Norvig spell corrector with frequency-based language model
  - "Evaluated using comprehensive metrics: LLM-specific and ranking metrics"
  - Designed FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend with dual search/chat modes
stack:
  - Python
  - PyTorch
  - Transformers
  - NLTK
  - FastAPI
concepts:
  - RAG
  - Semantic Search
  - NLP
  - LLM
