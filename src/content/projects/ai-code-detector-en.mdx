title: "Detecting AI-generated Python code via ML"
role: "Developer"
period: "2025"
description:
  "A ML system for detecting AI-generated Python code
  in programming competitions. The project compares two approaches:
  transformer-based models (CodeBERT, DeBERTa) for deep semantic analysis
  and AST-based lightweight models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, MLP)
  for efficient structural pattern recognition"
achievements:
  - "Achieved 95.9% accuracy with CodeBERT model on synthetic dataset"
  - "Developed efficient AST-based Random Forest achieving 83.5% accuracy with 2ms inference time"
responsibilities:
  - "Engineered dataset generation pipeline using 4 LLMs (Evil, Llama-3.2-3b, BLACKBOX.AI, DeepSeek) with specialized prompts"
  - "Fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 and CodeBERT models"
  - "Implemented AST-based feature extraction using Tree-sitter library for structural code analysis"
  - "Integrated LIME explainability framework for model interpretation"
  - "Evaluated models across 6 metrics: F1 Score, ROC/AUC, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and inference time"
