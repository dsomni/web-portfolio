title: "EBREG-RL: Example-Based Regular Expression Generation via Reinforcement Learning"
role: Developer
period: "2025"
description:
  A reinforcement learning system for automatic regular expression generation
  from labeled examples. The project formulates regex generation as a Markov
  Decision Process using Reverse Polish Notation to handle operator precedence
achievements:
  - Successfully generated optimal regex patterns for number and word extraction tasks
  - Implemented novel reward functions combining F1 score, accuracy metrics, and length penalties
responsibilities:
  - Formulated regex generation as MDP with 104-action space using RPN tokens
  - Designed custom reward functions balancing pattern accuracy and expression complexity
  - Implemented and compared REINFORCE and A2C algorithms
stack:
  - Python
  - PyTorch
concepts:
  - Deep Reinforcement Learning
  - Policy Gradient Methods
  - NLP
